This is a gist clone because RailsCamp has no internetz.

Also it doesn't use any of your damn frameworks.

== Developing

    gem install shotgun
    shotgun # Serves app on localhost:9393, with autoreload

    rake # Runs a full build
 
Please note:
* I'm pretty opiniated about the structure of this app, so talk to me before you do any refactorings otherwise I'll probably reject them.
* `rake` must pass on EVERY commit. No temporary commits. Keep everything working.
